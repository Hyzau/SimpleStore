# SimpleStore

A SimpleStore class related to an assignment in TypeScript.
Store.ts is located in the src folder.
Webpack is used to bundle files for the web.

## Installation

```
npm install -y
```
## Build

```
npm run build
```

## Execution

```
node build/bundle.js
```
index.html should have been an interface to quickly test and add element to the Store but I ran out of time.

You should be able to change the package.json "build" to "tsc" and avoid using webpack.
